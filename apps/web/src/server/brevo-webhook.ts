 * Brevo transactional webhook. Brevo adds its own List-Unsubscribe header to
 * every email, so people can stop the mail from their mail app without ever
 * touching the site; this keeps the roster in step with that, and also drops
 * addresses that bounce hard or mark us as spam.
 *
 * All of it lands as an open-ended break, never a deactivation: not being
 * able to reach somebody is not grounds for throwing them out of the group,
 * and only an admin does that anyway. The reason says what happened so it is
 * obvious on the admin page that this was Brevo and not the person.
 *
 * Registered with `auth: { type: "bearer", token: BREVO_WEBHOOK_SECRET }`
 * (see README "Email"). Events arrive one per request, or as an array when
 * the webhook was created with `batched: true`.
